According to the Segmented Discourse Rhetorical Theory, the rhetorical structure of a dialogue can be represented by a directed acyclic graph, where nodes are utterances and edges are the following 16 relations:

{
'Comment':'',
"Clarification_question":"",
"Elaboration":"",
"Acknowledgement":"",
"Explanation":"",    
"Conditional":"",    
"Question-answer pairs":"",
"Alternation":"",
"Question-Elaboration":"",
"Result":"",
"Background":"",
"Narration":"",
"Correction":"",
"Parallel":"",
"Contrast":"",
"Continuation":""
}

please annotate the rhetorical structure of the following dialogue and represent it in the form of [index1, index2, 'relation'], where index1 and index2 are the index of two utterances, and the 'relation' is one of the above relations to connect the two utterances.
